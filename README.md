# HashtableProject
Program I developed for an advanced data structures module. 

The projects is an implementation of a Hashtable file structure that stores a list of names (In this case a input files of popular boys names) using a hash algorithm.

Several approaches have been implemented such as chaining vs open adressing and well as division vs multiplication hash functions. 
There is also a rudimentary test framework.
